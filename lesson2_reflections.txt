What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    -Make the directory behaves as a "local" repository. Though, it is not uploaded to github yet (i.e. not committed)
	-Do this initialization so the git knows the scope of the repository, rather than just some random files.
	-Arguably, if git auto committed, the parent folder used may be the directory for repository. But that's
	-probably too sudden a change
     To initialize a directory for repository in the git server. Otherwise, we wouldn't know where to put the files.
     Also, with the staging area, initialization without commit allows us to select specific files to commit, rather
	than every file in the working directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
   
     It allows a place holder for the files to be committed to the repo. Without it, all the files in the working
	directory will need to be committed to the repo.
